Why I Built This?
I created this Net Hourly Rate Calculator during my job search in New York City and San Francisco. I wanted a simple way to understand exactly how much money I would be paying in taxes and how much I would actually be taking home in both cities. Since the cost of living and tax structures vary greatly between these areas, I needed a tool that could calculate my net hourly rate after factoring in federal, state, and city taxes.

This calculator helps me (and others) easily see the difference between the gross income weâ€™re offered by employers and the net income we actually receive, which is crucial for budgeting and making informed decisions during a job search.

What I build?

I built this Net Hourly Rate Calculator as a tool to help users determine how much of their income is actually received after taxes. This app takes into account both federal, state, and city taxes, allowing users to input either their gross annual salary or their hourly wage. It then calculates the net income (i.e., take-home pay) and breaks it down by the amount of taxes paid, helping users better understand their financial situation.

The app also allows users to select different states and cities (e.g., New York City and San Francisco) so that they can see how local tax structures affect their net hourly rate. This is especially useful for comparing job offers across different regions or making financial decisions when living in high-tax cities.
